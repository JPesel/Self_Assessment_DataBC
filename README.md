# Final Assessment DataBC

## Self Assessment
I think i learned a lot, i had some experience with data bases but i had no idea the full scope of the skills and data that would be encompassed during.
I think most of my role was mostly on the dash board and the machine learning side, where i think most of my work went to trying to clean the data and decide what kind of sampling to use to correct the bias for people not entering the ICU.
The most hallenging part for me was coordinating the work between me and Daniel so that the both of us wouldn't work on the same tasks at the same time, having to use github for this was very useful.

## Team Assessment
Since most of the time it was only daniel and me working it wasn't too much of a hastle to manage comunication between us, we made sure to schedule extra sesion between us to make sure the work was going smoothly.
I think the best tip we have is to clearly point out who is handling which tasks so that work can flow.

## Summary of project
The project is aimed to model the probability in Mexico to require Intensive Care Unit treatment if infected with the novel COVID-19 virus and the patients are affected with existing pre-conditions, such as Pneumonia, Diabetes, COPD, Asthma, Cardiovascular Disease among others.
With this data we ran a machine learning model to predict with the underlying conditions wether or not the patient would have to be admited in the ICU.
